7) program to find reverse of a number
class Reverse{  
	public static void main(String[] args)   
{  
	int number = 82777;
	int reverse = 0;  
	while(number != 0)   
{  
	int remainder = number % 10;  
	reverse = reverse * 10 + remainder;  
	number = number/10;  
	}  
	System.out.println("The reverse of the given number is: " + reverse);  
}  
}

8) program to find hors into seconds

	class HoursToSeconds{

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int hours=1;
		System.out.println("Please enter hours:");
		long seconds = hours * 60 * 60;

		System.out.println("Converted hours to Seconds:" +seconds);
